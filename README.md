Python Recommender Systems

This is a set of programs that emulate some of the functions of a 
search engine recommending user, movies to watch

Implemented 6 different Recommender Systems and compared their performances

For running 1st Recommender System(Collaborative)
run command:-
python collab_filtering.py

For running 2nd Recommender System(Collaborative filtering with baseline approach)
run command:-
python collab_filtering_baseline.py

For running 3rd Recommender System(SVD)
run command:-
python svd.py

For running 4th Recommender System(SVD with energy-consideration)
run command:-
python svd_energy.py

For running 5th Recommender System(CUR)
run command:-
python cur.py

For running 6th Recommender System(CUR with energy-consideration)
run command:-
python cur_energy.py

All of them outputs predicted ratings along with required errros and running time
